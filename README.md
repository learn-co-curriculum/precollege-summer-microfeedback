## Student Micro Feedback
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/survey.jpg" width="400">

It's important for students to feel empowered in the classroom, and part of that means making them feel like they have a place to provide feedback and improve the quality of their experience.

We do that by taking student micro feedback at the end of every class.

Students must fill out a slip of paper at the end of every class with the following information:
* Name
* Were you in your...comfort, learning, or panic zone
* Was class...boring, fine, fun
* Was class...easy, medium, hard
* Any additional comments
